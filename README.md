# cpp-client
C++ OpenTracing binding for Jaeger

jaeger-cpp is a client library to emit trace information for the Jaeger trace
collector <http://jaeger.readthedocs.io>.

It's written in C++11 and implements the OpenTracing API; see [ot-url] and
https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-cpp.

This library is just an agent. It sends UDP packets to a trace collector, which
does all the real work. Agent libraries also exist for other languages like
Java and Go.

## Quick build

To do a test build and install in $HOME/jaeger-cpp-client:

    git clone https://github.com/jaegertracing/cpp-client.git jaeger-cpp-client
    mkdir jaeger-cpp-build
    cd jaeger-cpp-build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/jaeger-cpp-client ../jaeger-cpp-client
    make
    make install

## Usage

To use jaeger-cpp in your code you mostly use the OpenTracing C++ APIs. Your code
must instantiate and configure the Jaeger tracer, but the rest is the same as for
any other OpenTracing backend.

The simplest way to instantiate and configure a Jaeger tracer is to use the
yaml configuration support to create the tracer. Then set it as the OpenTracing
global tracer. Typically a caller would read the configuration in from a file,
but as an example:

    #include <jaegertracing/Tracer.h>

    void initTracing()
    {
        constexpr auto kConfigYAML = R"cfg(
            disabled: false
            sampler:
                type: const
                param: 1
            reporter:
                queueSize: 100
                bufferFlushInterval: 10
                logSpans: false
                localAgentHostPort: 127.0.0.1:6831
            headers:
                jaegerDebugHeader: debug-id
                jaegerBaggageHeader: baggage
                TraceContextHeaderName: trace-id
                traceBaggageHeaderPrefix: "testctx-"
            baggage_restrictions:
                denyBaggageOnInitializationFailure: false
                hostPort: 127.0.0.1:5778
                refreshInterval: 60
            )cfg";

        const auto config = jaegertracing::Config::parse(YAML::Load(kConfigYAML));
        auto tracer = jaegertracing::Tracer::make("postgresql", config);
        opentracing::Tracer::InitGlobal(tracer);
    }

    void teardownTracing()
    {
        opentracing::Tracer::Global()->Close
    }

A C++-language configuration facility is also-available; see
`jaegertracing/Config.h` and the jaeger-cpp tests. A trivial example:

    auto config = jaegertracing::Config(
        false,
        jaegertracing::samplers::Config(jaegertracing::kSamplerTypeConst, 1),
        jaegertracing::reporters::Config(
            jaegertracing::reporters::Config::kDefaultQueueSize,
            std::chrono::seconds(1), true));


Once instantiated, simple traces may be performed with the usual opentracing
facilities e.g.:

    #include <chrono>
    #include <thread>

    int main()
    {
        initTracing();

        auto tracer = opentracing::Tracer::Global();
        auto span = tracer->StartSpan("abc");
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds{10});
        span->Finish();
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds{5});

        teardownTracing();
    }

The Jaeger tracing instance usually lives as long as the traced process.

### Usage from C

It's possible to use `jaeger-cpp` from C with appropriate `extern "C"` thunks
and care around resource lifetime management etc. A real world example is the
support for opentracing and jaeger in ngnix; see
https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/nginx-opentracing . A simplified example
would be welcomed.

### Usage from C++98

## Dependencies
---

Compiling jaeger-cpp requires:

* opentracing-cpp <https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-cpp>
* nlohmann json (2.1.0 or greater) <https://github.com/nlohmann/json>
* yaml-cpp <https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp>
* boost regex <http://www.boost.org>
* Apache thrift <https://thrift.apache.org/>
* Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest>

By default, Jaeger uses Hunter <http://hunter.sh> to download required
depenencies (including opentracing) from the Internet as part of the CMake
build preparation.

If `-DHUNTER_ENABLED=0` is passed to `cmake` then all these dependencies must
be locally instaled.

### Fedora

These dependencies are all in Fedora 25+ except for nlohmann json 2.1.x.

Install with:

    sudo dnf install yaml-cpp-devel boost-devel thrift-devel gtest-devel

There's a nlohmann json package `json-cpp` too, but it's too old so you'll
have to compile it yourself.

## Build options

CMake flags available for setting with `-D`:

* `HUNTER_ENABLED`: set to 0 to disable the use of the Hunter dependency
  fetching/building tool to download jaeger-cpp's dependencies. Enabled by
  defualt.

* `BUILD_TESTING`: set to 0 to disable test compilation

* `JAEGERTRACING_WITH_YAML_CPP`: disable yaml configuration support
